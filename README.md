# 📈 Recommendation Systems CTR Prediction using SOTA Models on the MIND Benchmark

This project experiments with **state-of-the-art (SOTA) recommendation algorithms** on the **Microsoft News Dataset (MIND)** to benchmark their effectiveness for **CTR prediction and personalized ranking**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project provides a **systematic comparison of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms** using a **realistic, content-rich benchmarking dataset**. The objective is to understand how different classes of recommender systems address key gaps in modern recommendation pipelines, including:

- Personalization  
- Ranking quality  
- Cold-start scenarios  
- Sequential behavior modeling  
- Content understanding  

Rather than proposing a single model, this project adopts a **benchmarking-first approach** and evaluates representative algorithms from multiple paradigms under a **unified experimental framework**, including:

- Collaborative filtering  
- Deep learning–based recommenders  
- Sequential models  
- Graph-based methods  
- Text-aware and LLM-enhanced approaches  

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Modern recommendation systems operate under **diverse and often competing constraints**, such as:

- Sparse user feedback  
- Rapidly changing user intent  
- Rich item content  
- Exposure bias in ranking  

No single algorithm performs best across all scenarios.

This project aims to:

- **Identify key gaps** in recommendation systems  
- **Evaluate how different algorithm families address these gaps**  
- **Highlight trade-offs** between model complexity, data requirements, and performance  

By grounding all experiments in the same benchmarking dataset, the comparisons remain **fair, reproducible, and practically relevant**.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

This project uses the **Microsoft News Dataset (MIND)**, a large-scale public benchmark released by Microsoft for research in **news recommendation and personalized ranking systems**.

The dataset contains:
- Rich **user behavior logs**
- Detailed **item (news) metadata**
- Explicit **impression-level interactions**

Unlike many traditional recommendation datasets that only capture post-hoc interactions (such as ratings or purchases), MIND provides **impression-level data**, including both **clicked and non-clicked items**. This enables learning from **true user choice behavior**, which is critical for **ranking and CTR prediction** tasks.

---

## 🎯 Why This Dataset Is Relevant for Recommendation Systems

The MIND dataset supports **end-to-end recommendation research**, from representation learning to ranking evaluation.

### ✅ Rich Item Metadata
Each news article includes:
- Title  
- Abstract  
- Category and sub-category  
- Entity annotations  

This enables **text-aware and content-based recommendation**, including modern Transformer and LLM-based embedding approaches.

### ✅ User Interaction Histories
The dataset provides **sequential user reading histories**, allowing models to capture:
- Short-term user intent  
- Long-term user preferences  

### ✅ Impression-Level Interaction Logs
For each user session, the dataset records:
- Which items were shown  
- Which items were clicked  

This makes MIND suitable for **ranking and CTR prediction**, not just implicit feedback modeling.

### ✅ Realistic Recommendation Setting
The combination of user context, item content, and exposure-aware interactions closely mirrors **real-world recommendation and advertising systems**.

## 🔍 Typical Use Cases

- Learning user and item embeddings from textual content  
- Evaluating ranking models using click vs. non-click impressions  
- Studying user interest evolution over time  
- Benchmarking content-aware and hybrid recommendation architectures  

---

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

This project benchmarks models from multiple recommendation paradigms, including:

- Classical and neural collaborative filtering methods  
- Sequential and session-based recommenders  
- Content-aware and hybrid recommendation models  
- Attention-based and Transformer-style architectures  
- LLM-assisted representation learning and ranking  

Each model is evaluated **with respect to the specific recommendation gap it is designed to address**, rather than purely on aggregate metrics.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The ultimate goal of this project is to serve as a **practical reference and benchmarking guide** for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand:

> **Which recommendation algorithms work best under which conditions — and why.**
